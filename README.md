# Responsive Error and Success Modals

This is a simple front-end modal with overlay. There is no back-end to this project, it is strictly style-focused

This modal was part of a class project using Blockchain technology. I made a decentralized diary with Blockstack and wanted to create a nice modal that would validate whether or not a post was successfully saved. So here it is!

Since there's no real validation event in this example, I've added two buttons to the page that will either trigger the error modal or the success modal. 

This is done using vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I used Flexbox as my primary layout model.
